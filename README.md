# LudogorieHackEnter-2024

#### The project was developed in order to participate in the Ludogorie Hack 2024 programming competition

A platform for creating business contacts

Context: In big cities like Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, etc. are organized
networking events. Dozens or
hundreds of people going to meet other entrepreneurs and yes
making useful business contacts. 

Problem: Because there are many people at these events, one participant cannot
meet and talk to everyone. Accordingly, it will be more useful to talk mainly with people,
which may be useful to him or he to them.
Solution: To make a platform where you create a profile where you describe yourself
yourself, where you studied, where you work, what professional experience you have and what you can do
to help As well as what skills you lack and need someone to help you with
with this.

Example profile: Genoveva Petrakieva, graduate of Ecology at SU. Works as
ecologist at BAS and wants to start his own business to educate consumers
on the topic of ecology. Genoveva has good design and drawing skills as needed
from marketing, advertising and finance.

Sample list of skills: IT, Marketing, Management, Business Development, People
resources, Finance, Education, Tourism, Sales, Media
The app should be able to send a friend request. Also
to be able to send messages.

There may be a special Event Attendance mode that will be used when
an event occurs. For example, on April 24 at 7 p.m. in Varna there is an event at Bar Nazdrave.
Every user who is at the event can be marked as present after
this to filter only people who attend the event. And to implement
contact them live afterwards.

Can the platform encourage people to make contacts - as in
social networks you have suggestions for friends based on common interests.
You can see an example of such a much more complex platform here. In the video
you can see the most important functionalities that the platform in question
owns - every person has a profile and when they are at a given event, they have
the opportunity to connect (the so-called matching) with people who would be useful to him or
he to them.
